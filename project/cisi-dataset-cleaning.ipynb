To evaluate the effect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measures of similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved.

       " ' An experimental computer program has been developed to classify documents according to the 80 sections and five major section groupings of Chemical Abstracts (CA).  The program uses pattern recognition techniques supplemented by heuristics.  During the \"training\" phase, words from pre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrence of each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a reference dictionary.  The \"classification\" phase matches each word of a document title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristic techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification phase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence the section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance and human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.  The program assigned approximately 78% of the documents to the correct major section groupings of CA and 67% of the correct sections or cross-references at a rate of 100 documents per second.',\n",

This communication shows that the approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisons only if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexing terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be compared several times over and the computation will be greater than when conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.',\n",

       " ' Keen, P.G.W. Decision Support Systems (DSS) represent a concept of the role of computers within the decision making process.  The term has become a rallying cry for researchers, practitioners, and managers concerned that Management Science and Management Information Systems fields have become unnecessarily narrow in focus.  As with many rallying cries, the term is not well defined.  For some writers, DSS simply mean interactive systems for use by managers.  To others, the key issue is support, rather than system.  They focus on understanding and improving the decision process; a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving them access to analytic models.  The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to situations where a \"final\" system can be developed only through an adaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy must then focus on getting finished; this is very different from Management Science and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSS center around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learning representation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture and strategies for getting started.',\n",

The way the cost data are presented is grossly unfair to the online mode of access and use.  This work contains corrected information regarding online and printed services in libraries.\",\n",
       " \" Many information scientists are concerned with the operation of document retrieval systems serving scientists in various fields.  The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.\",\n",
       " ' One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involves entering pairs of authors\\' names believed to be jointly cited by subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a \"general social indicators\" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators (SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic in nature.  As expected, they were relatively \"harder\" than the first group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked through citations in certain papers.  An additional result is that papers citing at least three of the input authors tend to be overviews of the SI movement.',\n",
       " ' The number of databases, records contained in databases and the online use of databases has increased dramatically over the past several years, bringing the 1979 totals for bibliographic, bioliographic-related, and natural language databases to 528.  These 528 databases contain 148 million records.  Some 4 million online searches were conducted via the major U.S. and Canadian systems in 1979.',\n",
       " ' A method of iterative searching, using the results of one iteration search to formulate the next iteration search, was applied to a full-text database consisting of some 2400 documents and 1,3000,000 text-words of Hebrew and Aramaic.  The iterative method consists of clustering the documents returned in an iteration, using weighting by proximity and by frequency simultaneously. The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall simultaneously.  Further experiments using more test-queries run on even larger databases should be made to collect further evidence as to the performance of these methods.',\n",

       " ' A major deficiency of traditional Boolean systems is their inability to represent the varying degrees to which a document may be written on a subject. In this article we isolate a number of criteria that should be met by any Boolean system generalized to have a weighting capability.  It is proven that only one weighting rule satisfies these conditions--that associated with fuzzy- set theory--and that this weighting scheme satisfies most of the other properties associated with Boolean algebra as well.  Probabilistic weighting is then introduced as an alternative approach and the two systems compared. In the limit of zero/one weights, all systems considered converge to traditional Boolean retrieval.',\n",
       " ' Several papers have appeared that have analyzed recent developments in the problem of processing, in a document retrieval system, queries expressed as Boolean expressions.

Recent articles have analyzed retrieval systems with continuous weights of either type and/or with a Boolean structure for the queries.  They have also suggested criteria which such systems ought to satisfy and record evaluation mechanisms which partially satisfy these criteria.  We offer a more careful analysis, based on a generalization of the discrete weights.  We also look at the weights from an entirely different approach involving thresholds, and we generate an improved evaluation mechanism which seems to fulfill a larger subset of the desired criteria than previous mechanisms.  This new mechanism allows the user to attach a \"threshold\" to the query term.',\n",
       " ' Online retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end users, because of heterogeneity and complexity.  Investigations have concerned the concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify access to, and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and databases.  The interface allows users to make requests in a common language. These requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commands for whatever system is being interrogated.  System responses may also be transformed by the interface into a common form before being given to the users.  Thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single \"virtual\" system to the user.  The interface also provides instruction and other search aids for the user.  The philosophy, design, and implementation of an experimental interface named CONIT are described.',\n",
       " ' The evaluation of the concept of a translating compuyter interface for simplifying operation of multiple, heterogenous online bibliographic retrieval systems has been undertaken.  An experimental retrieval system, named CONIT, was built and tested under controlled conditions with inexperienced end users.  A detailed analysis of the experimental usages showed that users were able to master interface operation sufficiently well to find relevant document references.  Success was attributed, in part, to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.  It is concluded that operational interfaces of the type studied can provide for increased usability of existing system in a cost effective manner, especially for searchers. Furthermore, more advanced interfaces based on improved instruction and automated search strategy techniques could further enhance retrieval effectiveness for a wide class of users.',\n",

       " ' The frequency characteristics of terms in the documents of a collection have been used as indicators of term importance for content analysis and indexing purposes.  In particular, very rare or very frequent terms are normally believed to be less effective than medium-frequency terms.  Recently automatic indexing theories have been devised that use not only the term frequency characteristics but also the relevance properties of the terms. The major term-weighting theories are first briefly reviewed.  The term precision and term utility weights that are based on the occurrence characteristics of the terms in the relevant, as opposed to the nonrelevant, documents of a collection are then introduced.  Methods are suggested for estimating the relevance properties of the terms based on their overall occurrence characteristics in the collection.  Finally, experimental evaluation results are shown comparing the weighting systems using the term relevance properties with the more conventional frequency-based methodologies.',\n",

Effectiveness is measured in terms of precision and recall, and the retrieval tests are done on three different test collections.',\n",

The present article assesses the validity of this substitution in various environments.',\n",
       " \" A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of the Colon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation and retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primary information is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposed to secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, a table of contents, or an index. Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicited from specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, along with four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various features of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simple word occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results against types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrieval performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected search length reduction factors. Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did not perform significantly better than the other systems.\",\n",

Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.',\n",

       " ' It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their \"distances\" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authors are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows (1) identifiable author groups (akin to \"schools\") of information science, (2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of authors within group and across group boundaries (\"border authors\" who seem to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with respect to the map\\'s axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the extent that those areas rely on serial publications.
